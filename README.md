# Anvel To Unity

Code to interface with [Anvel](https://anvelsim.com/) data inside of Unity.

Requires Unity 2018's .NET 4.x profile (or experimental 4x in 2017) to properly use Anvel's dlls.

PRs and Issues are welcome.

## Lidar and Vehicle Data

Supports lidar playback files (.pcrp) and vehicle playback files (.vprp) using Unity's particle system and multithreading for low latency playback
